*Face images and mark coordinates are required. Some dataset used existing images from other dataset, in which case the dataset was named after the image dataset.*

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
OpenCV 4.x

### Installing
Just git clone this repo and you are good to go.

```shell
# From your favorite development directory
git clone https://github.com/yinguobing/facial-landmark-dataset
```

## How to run

First, initialize the dataset. Take 300W as an example.
```python
from fmd.ds300w import DS300W

# Set the path to the dataset directory.
DS300W_DIR = "/home/robin/data/facial-marks/300W"

# Construct a dataset.
ds = DS300W("300w")

# Populate the dataset with essential data
ds.populate_dataset(DS300W_DIR)

# See what we have got.
print(ds)
```
Possible output:

```bash
name: 300w
authors: Imperial College London
year: 2013
num_marks: 68
num_samples: 600
```

### Pick one sample, randomly

Once the dataset is constructed:
```python
sample = ds.pick_one()
```

### Enumerate the dataset
This could be useful when you are trying to transform or export the dataset.
```python
for sample in ds:
    # do whatever you want, like
    print(sample.marks)
```

### Read image file
Read in the image file as a numpy array, and show the image.

```python
image = sample.read_image()

import cv2
cv2.imshow("Preview", image)
cv2.waitKey()
```

### Get the full marks

```python
facial_marks = sample.marks
```

### Get the key marks
The key marks are: left eye left corner, left eye right corner, right eye left corner, right eye right corner, mouse left corner, mouse right corner.

```python
key_marks = sample.get_key_marks()
```

### Draw the marks
```python
draw_marks(image, facial_marks)
```
